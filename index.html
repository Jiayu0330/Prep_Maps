    <div class="question">
      What are two mistakes that people often make when creating visualizations with maps?
    </div>
    <ul>
      <li>When people are doing a map with circles, they sometimes simply create a new circle by using percentage of the original one. However, it gives wrong sizes. People should use the formula - (square root of the new value over the largest value) * the radius of the old circle.</li>
      <li>People sometimes trust software defaults. However, there are some flaws when they are solving specific questions.</li>
    </ul>
